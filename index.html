	NEW YORK CITY - NOVEMBER 30, 2024
	<br>
	<br>
	With the election of Donald Trump and the plans that leading conservative think tanks laid out in Project 2025, people around the country are beginning to wonder what is going to happen to their city's federally funded operations. 
	<br>
	<br>
	This below chart demonstrates the New York City agencies which are supposed to have over 10% of their budget coming from federal funding through fiscal year 2025 (which spans from July 1, 2024 to June 30, 2025). The NYC agencies with the highest percentage of federal funding are the Department of Housing Preservation and Development, the Administration for Children's Services, and the Department of City Planning. As the chart indicates, the total amount of money each agency is supposed to receive from the federal government is indicated on the right side of the bars.

	Although the Trump campaign attempted to distance themselves from Project 2025 as the election drew closer, the president-elect has <a href="https://www.axios.com/2024/11/26/trump-picks-project-2025-russ-vought">appointed key authors</a> to his cabinet. For example, Russ Vought has been selected to direct the Office of Management and Budget and Brendan Carr has been picked to head the Federal Communications Commission. 
<br>
<br>
	Some of the measures laid out in Project 2025 that can have the greatest impact on New York City are threats to federal funding for abortion providers and gender-affirming healthcare practices, preventing mixed-status families from accessing federally subsidized housing, defunding universal daycare programs, ending the Head Start program, and of course, mass deportations of undocumented immigrants.
